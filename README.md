There is currently a bug with the creation of new projects where when creating a project the pop-up won't close on project creation and the project won't appear on the dashboard until you log out and log back in. This is a problem that arose when hosting the code on a new server and I am currently working to remedy the problem if you have any suggestions please feel free to comment.
